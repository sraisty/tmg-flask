"""

There are five file types:
I = Information Record (24 fields separated by semi-colons)
D = Individual Entry Record (18 fields separated by semi-colons)
E = Individual Entry Record (14 fields separated by semi-colons)
Q = Relay Entry Record (15 or more fields separated by semi-colons) R = Relay Entry Record (10 or more fields separated by semi-colons)
It is preferred that the D file type be used instead of the E file type and that the Q file type be used instead of the R file type. These newer D and Q file types contain more information.
Rules
1. If no information for a given field, leave it blank, but include the semi-colon.
2. Each record must be followed by a carriage return & line feed.
3. If at any point in a record, all remaining fields in the record are blank, it can be ended with a
carriage return without all the extra semi-colons.
4. For each athlete there can be one information record. You create one E record or D record for
each individual entry. The 2nd thru 10th fields of both the I, D and E record types are identical. One
relay per relay entry record with up to 8 relay runner names.
5. The order of each record makes no difference.
6. For each I, D or E record for the same athlete, fields 2 through 8 must be the same.
7. The I record is optional and thus not required.
